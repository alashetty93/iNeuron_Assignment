    "### Q1. Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?\n",
    "Ans: A=A+1 evaluates to finding A, adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable A. This expression makes Python to look for memory holder of 'a' twice. But A+=1 simply means value of A is to incremented by 1. As memory address has to be identified once, += leads to faster operation.\n",

    "### Q2. What is the smallest no of statements you'd have to write in most programming languages to replace the Python expr a, b = a + b, a ?\n",

    "### Q7. From the command line, how do you get support with a user-written Python programme? Is this possible from inside IDLE?\n",
    "Ans: Get support with a user-written Python Programme: Start a command prompt (Windows) or terminal window (Linux/Mac). If the current working directory is the same as the location in which you saved the file, you can simply specify the filename as a command-line argument to the Python interpreter.\n",

    "Get support with a User-written Python Program from IDLE: You can also create script files and run them in IDLE. From the Shell window menu, select File → New File. That should open an additional editing window. Type in the code to be executed. From the menu in that window, select File → Save or File → Save As… and save the file to disk. Then select Run → Run Module. The output should appear back in the interpreter\n",

    "Ans: The tasks which can be performed with the functions in python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is an instance of the Object type.\n",
    "You can store the function in a variable.\n",
    "You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.\n",
    "You can return the function from a function.\n",
    "You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists,\n",
    "Q9. How do you distinguish between a wrapper, a wrapped feature, and a decorator?\n",
    "Ans: Wrappers Around the functions are known as Decrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. If a function is a generator function, what does it return?\n",
    "Ans: Generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. What is the one improvement that must be made to a function in order for it to become a generator function in the Python language?\n",
    "Ans: Generator is a written as normal function but uses yield keyword to return values instead of return keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. Identify at least one benefit of generators.\n",
    "Ans: return statement sends a specified value back to its caller whereas yield statment can produce a sequence of values. We should use generator when we want to iterate over a sequence, but don’t want to store the entire sequence in memory."
