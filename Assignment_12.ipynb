    "Ans: If a PdfFileReader object’s PDF is encrypted with the password swordfish and we are not aware of it, we will first read the Pdf using the PdfFileReader Class. PdfFileReader class provides a attribute called isEncrypted to check whether a pdf is encrypted or not. The method returns true if a pdf is encrypted and vice versa.\n",

    "Ans: The structure of a document is represented by three different data types in python-Docx. At the highest level, a Document object represents the entire document. The Document object contains a list of Paragraph objects for the paragraphs in the document. (A new paragraph begins whenever the user presses ENTER or RETURN while typing in a Word document.) Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n",

    "The text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes."
