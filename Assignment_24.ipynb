    "### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: def statement is used to create a normal function whereas lambda expressions are used to create Anonymous functionswhich can be assigned to a variable and can be called using the variable later in function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda's body is a single expression and not a block of statements like def statement. The lambda expression's body is similar to what we wouldd put in a def body's return statement. We simply type the result as an expression instead of explicitly returning it. Because it is limited to an expression, a lambda is less general than a def statement.\n",

    "Avoid using digits while choosing a variable name\n",
    "Try to use a name for the function which conveys the purpose of the function\n",
