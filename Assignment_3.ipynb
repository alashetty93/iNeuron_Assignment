    "Ans: The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is specified. When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Example is mentioned below:"

A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function whereas A variable created in the main body of the Python code is a global variable and belongs to the global scope."

    "## 6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans: When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten. A local variable becomes undefined after the function call completes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans: The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods. We can use the return statement to make functions send Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the functionâ€™s return value. A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans: If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None. The function always returns None if explicit return is not written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans: A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans: The data type of None is NoneType.\n",
